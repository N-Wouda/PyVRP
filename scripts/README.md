# Scripts

This folder contains various helper scripts that simplify the build and 
installation process.

> *Note* that all scripts assume two things: first, that they are executed 
> within the local poetry environment, and second, that they are executed from
> the repository root directory. In practice, you should thus run each script 
> as `poetry run scripts/<script name>`.
